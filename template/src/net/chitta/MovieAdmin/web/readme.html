      <h1>Movie Adminstration Sample Application Read Me</h1>
<p><b>Movie Administration</b> is an example that demonstrates how to 
use virtual forms, ObjectListDataProvider, and RequestBean in Netbeans.</p>

<p>The Movie Administration example is a simple administrative application for a movie rental business. 
The business maintains data about its movie collection in a data store, and the administrative application enables 
employees to make changes to that data. The business also has a separate external web site that enables customers 
to browse the collection. The same data store is used for the external web site.</p>

<p>An employee using the application can view the movies in a particular genre by making a selection in 
the <b>Current Genre</b> dropdown list. The <b>Movies</b> table shows the movies in the current genre.
Within the Movies table, the title, year, 
length in minutes, rating, image URL, and description fields can be edited; the 
changes are saved when the employee clicks the <b>Update</b> button or uses the 
table's paging controls (when available). The employee can remove a movie from 
the collection by clicking the <B>Remove</B> button in one of the rows. Clicking 
the <b>Preview</b> button in one of the rows navigates to 
<tt>Preview.jsp</tt>, which enables the employee to preview the detail page 
for a movie as it would be seen by a customer browsing the external web site. (<tt>Preview.jsp</tt> 
also enables the employee to change the genre of the movie being previewed.) A 
separate set of controls appears below the table for adding a movie to the 
collection.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: You must build the project before opening any of the pages otherwise the designtime experience 
will not be enjoyable, because an error message will be displayed in the Designer.</p>
